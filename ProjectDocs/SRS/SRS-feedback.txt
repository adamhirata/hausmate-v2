========================================================================================
The schedule is a good start, but you need to go longer than week 4 of the
project.  I'm sure you can figure that out.  I realize that you don't know
how long anything will take, but the scheduling exercise is to give you an
initial experience of *trying* to estimate realistically how long something
will take you as a group, based on the estimation of the individual parts.
You can fix that in the next iteration which is in the SDP.

The CSCI breakdown has too much information in it.  You only need to list
the modules, not all the sub-parts.  I think that if you get to more than
five "dot levels" that's too far.  Go for:

5.2.1    Graphical User Interface [GUI] CSC
5.2.1.1  Login screen CSU ~ [description]
         Includes:   Haus Creation Module
                     Haus Joining Module
5.2.1.2  Main screen CSU ~ [description]
         Includes:   Settings Menu Module
                     Profile Menu Module
                     Events Module
                     Lists Module
                     Announcements Module
                     Chat Module
                     Status Module
                     Tools Module

5.2.2    Database CSC
5.2.2.1  Haus Entity CSU ~ [description]
5.2.2.2  User Entity CSU ~ [description]
5.2.2.3  List Entity CSU ~ [description]
5.2.2.4  List Entry Entity CSU ~ [description]
5.2.2.5  Users Table CSU ~ [description]
5.2.2.6  Lists Table CSU ~ [description]

5.2.3    Server CSC
5.2.3.1  Authentication CSU ~ [description]
5.2.3.2  Notification System CSU ~ [description]
5.2.3.3  Database Server CSU ~ [description]
5.2.3.4  Database System CSU ~ [description]
5.2.3.5  Google Calendar API CSU ~ [description]

Note that for section 5.2.2, I just used what you already have.  You may not
need all of that, since it kind of looks like these are the tables in your
database.  Unless you are going to have a unique code module to handle every
table in your database, you don't need that level of detail.  You could put
all of that under a "Database I/O CSU" heading and color it done.

Section 5.2 looks GREAT!!  You guys nailed that one to the wall!

The only other thing is to watch the word wrapping in the document.  When it
wraps to a new line at the left margin, the doc gets kinda hard to read.  If
you use a word processor that has "hanging indents" it makes life easier.

GREAT WORK!!
