# Hausmate Proposal  
*By Adam, Jared, Miliano, and Ray*

### Description  
 One-in-three U.S. adults have an adult roommate. This number is growing [1]. Among the many causes for roommate conflicts, miscommunication and even no communication are especially problematic. This often leads to gossip, passive aggression, and a tense living environment. 

To promote friendships and proper communication, we introduce the concept of Hausmate. 

We believe that computers offer unique capabilities for making communication easier. While it is true that confronting problems in person is beneficial, this is only ideal. That is, there may be awkward situations warranting anonymity (there exists a share of horror stories). This application is no substitute for in-person interactions. If anything, it is a platform for general organization and communication that aids relational management.

The key features of this application will include:  
 
***- Status Updates***
Users can put a "mood" on their profile. Allowing roommates to be aware of their roomie's mental status to either help or give more space.  

***- Shared Calendars***  
If roommates want to socialize or hold an event at the room, they can schedule with ease.  

***- Chat System***  
This is a feature that centralizes communications as opposed to "I forgot to save your number"-telecommunications.  

***- Notifications***  
Users can be reminded of important events or chores in addition to chats.  

***- Shared Lists***  
This is a general feature with many potential uses. A few examples include groceries, chores, or even rules.  

***- Anonymous Board***
The greatest trouble with roommate relations is politics. There will always be a habit of one roommate that annoys the other. The problem is that, generally, there is at least a yearlong commitment to live with each other; thus, no one wants to break the peace by calling out issues. An anonymous complaint board could potentially alleviate this and lead to potentially greater conflict resolution.  

***- Announcements***  
This system notifies all roommates of any "happenings" around the room (e.g. parental visits, a need for a quiet study atmosphere, a planned dinner, etc.). 

Currently, the software required will include: React Native and AWS (for hosting). Firebase is under consideration depending on database needs. In terms of hardware, as computer scientists, computers will have to suffice.  

This application is most comparable to Discord and Slack; mainly with respect to the implementation of channels. The application is unique from other applications in that it is tailored towards any user who has a roommate. Moreover, it features anonymous posting, list-making, and more.  

It ought to be obvious that our end-user is any group of roommates; even families can use the application. The greatest benefit that this application offers the user is an "easier" means for communication. Where texts may be lost or phone calls are ignored, the application centralizes communication. Additionally, in-person confrontations may be difficult to initiate. The application could be a starting point for crucial conversations that maintain the peace of a home.  

### Justifications  

**1. Demonstration of Class-Derived Knowledge**  
This project will test our abilities to apply concepts from the following classes:

***- CMSI 301 Interaction Design***  
  In this class, we learned the fundamentals of developing user-friendly applications. Usability will be key to making our application unique and useful. Moreover, from a technical standpoint, we learned about technologies used in application development. As our project is a React Native application, development over the semester will utilize a heavy amount of the class material from Interaction Design.

***- CMSI 355 Networks***  
  Networks discussed the technical aspects of client-server interactions. An obvious area where skills from this class will be used is in client-side programming and fetching from a host of APIs. Another example of class experience coming into play lies with our use of AWS to host the application.

***- CMSI 486 Database Systems***  
Database principles will be essential to storing/retrieving data safely and efficiently. Our application will feature user and group profiles; both of which will require storing a bulk of information that provides for a functional application experience.

**2. Appropriate Technical Challenges and Timelines**  
None of us has had an internship. We don't see this as a hindrance to our ability to perform. However, in the grand scheme of the class objectives, there will be many challenges in learning how full-scale application development works. On the technical side, APIs, debugging, and meeting deadlines will be especially challenging given the size of our group. Thankfully, the availability of tools and technologies such as the Expo IDE, React Native, and AWS (to name few) will make our project possible. It is for these reasons that our project is justified to be within the "Goldilocks Zone" of difficulty.

**3. Personal Passions and Utility**  
As college students, we have lived (and are currently living) with roommates. Personally, we would benefit from this application's features at our fingertips. This application aligns with our experiences and, more importantly, our desire to make the occasional politics of living with roommates more simple. The app could also be useful for Universities to promote communication among roommate groups (especially random ones).
