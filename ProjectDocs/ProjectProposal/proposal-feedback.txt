Hausmate project
=================================
Presentation:
   I don't see a copy of your presentation slides in your repo.  Please put
   a copy in there.

   from what I remember of your presentation, it was pretty well-organized,
   and everyone knew which part they would describe, showing a good teamwork
   focus from the start.  I look forward to seeing what you guys produce, and
   I'm sure it will be most helpful, as you say, not only for room mates but
   also for families and others who are in confined spaces for prolonged
   periods of time, especially during the pandemic.  I wonder if there might
   be a use case for the workplace as well?

Proposal Document:
   very good description of your project in the proposal document!  having
   the breakdown of the intended application activities shows you have done
   some good thinking about the goals of the project, and you have presented
   good rationale for each of them.  the justification section is complete
   and well-documented in its approach to all the courses, and your reasons
   for challenges and the passion you all bring to the project are good to
   hear!

Great job on this presentation and proposal!

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus [as long as I see a copy of your
                                                presentation in your repo]
