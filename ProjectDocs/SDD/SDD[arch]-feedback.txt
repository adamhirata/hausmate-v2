========================================================================================
Very nice job on this architectural level document!  The descriptions are
clean and clear and the example screen views helo the reader understand what
you are describing.  Very effective there!

One thing to remember [which I'm not docking you for] is that in professional
quality documentation you always spell out whatever you will be referring to
with an acronym where it first occurs.  For example, under 6.2.1.2 you have:

User-to-user interaction control is tantamount to the implementation of an
SMS, which is based....

...which technically should be:

User-to-user interaction control is tantamount to the implementation of a
Short Message Service (SMS), which is based....

After it's defined this way, you can use "SMS" everywhere else and the reader
will know exactly to what you are referring.  I'm not taking off points, you
didn't know, but just be aware of this.

The diagrams you've done are excellent as well!  Perfect detail to tell the
implementation team what they should be building and how they should be
building it!

It looks like you have done enough work on this, actually, to count it as
both the architectural and detailed designs, so you've earned credit for both
of these assignments!

Nice work!
